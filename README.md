pretty basic homework learning c++ from a college class
obviously there were more assignments but these aren't really much to show
I liked C++ a lot and one day I'll get back into learning it


update 1/31/20
I'm just going to add all my C++ stuff until i actually find a reason for github
godspeed if you use/look at my code
